  "Minor sugar over Clara-Rules Expressions such that fact expressions can also
  be given in `[E A V]` triplet form, expanding to `[A (= (:e this) E) (= (:v 
  this) V)]`. We define a parser over expressions that makes the conversions.
  Standard Clara-Rules Expressions remain valid syntax except the extreme case
  where you would want `fact-type-fn` to return vectors, which is unlikely."
